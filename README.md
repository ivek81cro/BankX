Bank records - programming practice
Trying to make simple bank records project running in c++, saving records in binary file.
As end result it should have next functionalities: 
-input of new customers and accounts 
-searching by unique identification number (oib) and connecting accounts to names
-list of transactions per account or oib in timespan
-closing accounts but keeping record when and last state.
-browsing closed accounts.
-anything else i can think of....never worked in bank
