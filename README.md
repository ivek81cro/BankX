Bank records - programming practice<br>
Trying to make simple bank records project running in c++, saving records in binary file.<br>
As end result it should have next functionalities: <br>
-input of new customers and accounts <br>
-searching by unique identification number (oib) and connecting accounts to names<br>
-list of transactions per account or oib in timespan<br>
-closing accounts but keeping record when and last state.<br>
-browsing closed accounts.<br>
-anything else i can think of....never worked in bank<br>
